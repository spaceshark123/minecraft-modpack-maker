# [Minecraft Modpack Maker](https://minecraft-modpack-maker.onrender.com)

This **website** allows users to input a **list of mods** they want to make a modpack with, the **version** of minecraft, the **mod installer** to use, which **mod forums** to search on, and then collects all the mods into one **zip file** for easy download using **web scraping**, streamlining the process of creating **custom modpacks**, while allowing the customizability of real mod files as opposed to a modpack launcher.

This was my first fullstack application, and a great opportunity to learn about APIs, deployment, build tools, end-to-end integration, Node JS, Express JS, web scraping, and other details of the backend process.
